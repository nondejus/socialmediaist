| socialmediaism |
------------------

is a political, socialmedia, and economic philosophy encompassing a range of economic and socialmedia systems characterised by socialmedia ownership of the means of production

it includes the political theories and movements associated with such systems. socialmedia ownership can be public, collective, cooperative, or of equity. while no single definition encapsulates the many types of socialmediaism, socialmedia ownership is the one common element. 

socialmediaists disagree about the degree to which socialmedia control or regulation of the economy is necessary, how far society should intervene and whether government, particularly existing government, is the correct vehicle for change.
